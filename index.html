<h1>Protocol.Club</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This website explores the fundamental and unique learning 
opportunities provided by the implementation of standardized 
protocols. It is a place for curious minds to explore and experiment,
to educate and be educated about protocols and implementations old 
and new alike.</p>

<p>This document captures the author's basic requirements and offers
guidance regarding the use and purpose of this website.  Additional
guidance may be provided at any time. This document reflects the
experimental nature of that guidance and prepares it for future
inclusion in more formal protocol.club Guide.</p>

<h2>Status of This Website</h2>

<p>This website is now <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/5jQSioCScs">accepting new members</a>; it exists for educational
and entertainment purposes as outlined above.</p>

<p>This website is a member of the wider tildeverse and has been
inspired in part by Paul Ford's original <a href="http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a>.</p>

<p>While federated with the <a href="http://tilde.club/~pfhawkins/othertildes.html">rest of the tildeverse</a> via NNTP (et
cetera), protocol.club has a stronger focus on its particular
mission and has several differences from other tilde boxes, namely:
we have a <a href="https://goo.gl/QO0BVD">Code of Conduct</a>, and we have some resources available
locally to aid development of protocol implementations and new
draft protocols. We also serve pages over HTTPS.</p>

<p>Information about the current status of this website, any errata,
and how to provide feedback on it may be obtained at
<a href="https://protocol.club/">https://protocol.club</a>.</p>

<h2>General Notice</h2>

<p>This website is subject to change at any time. It may be unreliable,
insecure, non-conformant, or non-existent. Please be patient, don't
expect too much, and help to keep things fun for everyone.</p>
